### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Jakub. I am a javascript developer who does projects in discord.js library. Currently, I do not make any custom projects.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: www.botlista.pl
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: PHP
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Nowhere
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: Hi, my name is Jakub. I am a javascript developer who does projects in discord.js library. Currently, I do not make any custom projects.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: discord.even@interia.pl
- âš¡ Fun fact: Do you know how computers count? One of the faster multiplication algorithms:
We multiply the numbers 17 * 19:

17 19 rest 1
34 9 the rest 1
68 4 the rest 0
136 2 rest 0
272 1 remainder 0

We sum up the elements with a remainder of 1 on the left: 17 + 34 + 272 = 323
Correct result.

### It's over, see you later ğŸ‘‹
